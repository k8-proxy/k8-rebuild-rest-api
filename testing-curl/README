This script makes curl requests to the following endpoints:

1- /api/rebuild
2- /api/rebuild/file
3- /api/rebuild/base64
4- /api/rebuild/zipfile
5- /api/rebuild/s3tozip
6- /api/rebuild/s3tos3
7- /api/rebuild/ziptos3

and tells if each of them works fine.

note: Each endpoint requires different variables to be tested. Example values of theses variables are provided in the script but you should modify them as convenient.
